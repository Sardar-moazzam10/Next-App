      <h1>History</h1>
      <h3>Jane Goodall began her career in 1960 in Gombe National Park Tanzania. Her research on chimpanzees proved that they are close to humans not only genetically, but also in their behavior. At the beginning of her research, she was able to work in an untouched forest, but over the years, the local population cleared larger and larger areas of trees and destroyed animals.</h3>
